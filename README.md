A Simulated Experiment in Fluorescence Spectroscopy

## Abstract

The FluSpec educational software package is a fully contained tutorial on the technique of fluorescence spectroscopy as well as a simulator on which experiments can be performed.  The procedure for each of the experiments is also contained within the package along with example analyses of results that are obtained using the software.

## Requirements

The FluSpec software is provided as a standalone application.  Versions exist that run on standard Macintosh OSX or Windows environments. The software should be run in conjunction with a standard spreadsheet program for the plotting and labeling of the processed output data.

### Recommended Systems
It is anticipated the software will successfully run on a wide range of Macintosh and PC systems.  The following systems are examples of ones that have been successfully trialled:

#### Macintosh
* Mac OSX 10.6 or later
* 1 GB RAM
* Mac computer with an Intel processor 

#### Windows
* Windows XP or later
* 128 MB RAM or greater
* 300 MHz processor or faster

## Installation
